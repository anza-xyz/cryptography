Per-institution shielded pools on Solana: Groth16 over BN254, Poseidon
commitments, gnark circuits, verified on-chain by the generic
[Groth16 verifier program](https://github.com/solana-program/groth16-verifier-program).
Background: [goals.md](goals.md), [high_level_design.md](high_level_design.md),
tracker [anza-xyz/cryptography#123](https://github.com/anza-xyz/cryptography/issues/123).

This directory holds the framework: Go module, Poseidon library choice,
fixture tooling, Rust end-to-end harness against the verifier program, and
CI. Circuits are added on top of it.

## Layout

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `circuits/` | Go module (gnark): circuits, gadgets, fixture CLI |
| `circuits/poseidon/` | thin adapter over third-party circom-compatible Poseidon (native and gadget) |
| `circuits/smoke/` | trivial `A·B = C` circuit that exercises the pipeline end to end |
| `circuits/export/` | writes gnark's native `vk.bin` / `proof.bin` / `public.bin` |
| `circuits/cmd/privtx/` | `privtx <circuit>-fixture`: setup, prove, export |
| `fixtures/<circuit>/` | a key, proof and public witness per circuit, consumed by `e2e/` |
| `e2e/` | Rust crate (its own workspace, not a member of the repository root): fixture → on-chain format → verifier host path and SBF program |

## Poseidon

All hashing is the circom Poseidon over BN254 Fr: `x^5` S-box, 8 full rounds,
width-dependent partial rounds, capacity element 0, digest `state[0]`. These
are the parameters of circomlib, light-poseidon, Solana's `sol_poseidon`
syscall and `syscall/solana-bn254` in this repository, so a pool program can
recompute any in-circuit hash with one syscall.

No Poseidon is implemented here. The circuits use two public libraries:

- in-circuit: `github.com/vocdoni/gnark-crypto-primitives/hash/native/bn254/poseidon`,
  a gnark port of circomlib's `poseidon.circom`;
- native (witness side): `github.com/iden3/go-iden3-crypto/poseidon`, the
  reference implementation by circom's authors.

Compatibility is pinned by tests rather than assumed: the Go tests check both
against circomlib's published vectors and against each other on random inputs
for 1 to 5 inputs, and the Rust e2e crate exposes light-poseidon (the source
`syscall/solana-bn254` generates its constants from) for circuits to check
their in-circuit hashes against.

## Circuit rules

- Plain Groth16 only. No `std/rangecheck` or anything else built on
  `api.Commit`: under Groth16 those add commitment keys to the verifying key
  and a Pedersen commitment to the proof, which the on-chain verifier (and its
  `groth16-convert` parser) rejects. Range checks use `api.ToBinary`.
- Public inputs are in struct field order; document the order in the circuit
  package and assert it in the e2e test.
- Each circuit ships a fixture under `fixtures/<circuit>/` and an e2e test
  under `e2e/tests/` that verifies it on the host path and on the SBF program.

## Running

```bash
make lint           # gofmt + go vet; cargo fmt + clippy for e2e
make test-go        # Go: Poseidon vectors, gadget == native, circuit prove/verify
make test-e2e       # Rust (release): host-path verification of the fixtures
make verifier-sbf   # clone + build the verifier program (needs cargo build-sbf)
make test-e2e       # now also verifies the proofs inside the SBF program
make fixtures       # regenerate fixtures (random setup: bytes change)
```

The e2e crate is a standalone Cargo workspace: Mollusk brings in the SVM
runtime, which would otherwise bloat the root lockfile and every build in the
repository. It pins the verifier repository to one git revision (in
`e2e/Cargo.toml` and the `Makefile`); the fixture encodings
are gnark's native `WriteTo` / `MarshalBinary` forms, which that revision's
`groth16-convert` parses. The Groth16 setup in `privtx` is for development
only.

CI (`.github/workflows/private-tx.yml`, run only when this directory or the
workflow changes) lints and tests the Go side, builds the verifier program at
the pinned revision, regenerates the fixtures, and runs the e2e crate with the
SBF test enabled.
